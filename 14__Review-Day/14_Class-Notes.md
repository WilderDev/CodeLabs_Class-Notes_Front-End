# Class 14 - Review Day

## Concepts

- **Typescript:** _Typescript_ is a superset of Javascript, adding additional features such as static typing. Typescript helps developers to develop large applications to improve error catching and standardization.

- **Angular**: _Angular_ is a Javascript framework that allows you to create reactive Single-Page-Applications (SPA's).

- **SPA:** A _Single-Page-Application_ is an app composed of one file the user receives. The server will send the client ONE Html File that can dynamically change using javascript. Creating a SPA allows a very interactive experience and much faster loading times. The website will look and feel like a native mobile app.

- **Angular Versions:** There are two major _Angular versions_. Angular 1, typically called AngularJS, and Angular 2+. Angular 2 and beyond is a complete rewrite entirely different from AngularJS. We will be using Angular 12 in this course, which will be very similar to all versions from Angular 2, 3, 4 up to 12. Every six months, we get a new _version_ (not rewrite) of Angular.

- **CLI:** The _Command Line Interface_ is a terminal that accepts text input to execute operating system functions.

- **IDE:** The _Integrated Development Environment_ is a tool developers use to edit source code. Many IDE's have advanced features that enhance code quality and developer productivity. We will use Microsoft's Free IDE, Visual Studio Code in this course.

- **Component:** A _component_ is a section or feature of your application. Every component has its own template, style, and logic. The benefit is that they are reusable and controllable.

- **Data-Binding:** _Data-Binding_ is how we automatically update our pages template when our application state changes.

- **Event-Binding:** _Event-Binding_ is a one-way connection from the view/template to the data source/logic.

- **Two-Way-Binding:** _Two-Way-Binding_ is when we connect the view/template to the source/logic, and when either of them changes, they both update.

- **View Encapsulation:** _View Encapsulation_ is a build-in Angular feature where a component's CSS is locally scoped. Changing the paragraph styles inside a child component will not affect any sibling or parent components.

- **Component Lifecycle:** Angular offers many different _Lifecycle Hooks_ to run logic at specific points along the _Component Lifecycle_. Every component, once instantiated, will run through a few phases; this is the "lifecycle" of the component.

## Class Goal - Select a Personal Project

1. Ask yourself these questions
   - What am I interested in?
   - What skills do I already have?
   - What is something that could add value to someone I love/care about?
2. Browse a list of available API's
3. Brainstorm 10-15 potential ideas (in under 5 minutes... yes... set a timer)
4. Choose one that resonates with you and scope out the projects main features
5. Send a message to us with your idea

## OPTIONAL - Tour of Heros

I would highly recommend going over the [Tour of Heros](https://angular.io/tutorial) tutorial that Angular provides during this class either before or after completing most exercises!
